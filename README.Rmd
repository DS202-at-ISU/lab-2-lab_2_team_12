## Variable of Main Interest (#2)

We think that the variable of particular interest is probably the sale price. You can compare sale price to every other variable and try to find out why it is lower or higher.



## Exploration of Main Variable (#3)

The Main variable is the sale price. 


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(classdata)
library(ggplot2)
summary(ames$`Sale Price`)

ggplot(ames, aes(x = `Sale Price`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40)

```
The range of sale price is from \$0 to \$20,500,000. The median sale price is $170,900.


After Filtering for houses over 1,000,000 this is the filtered chart:


```{r, message=FALSE}

ames_filtered <- ames[ames$`Sale Price` < 1000000, ]

ggplot(ames_filtered, aes(x = `Sale Price`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40)

```

As a team we said generally most houses are under \$500,000, there appears to be a somewhat normal distribution centered around ~\$240,000. The sale price is right skewed.There are significant outliers that affect the data.




Isabel's Work:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Acres, y = `Sale Price`)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot")
```

- Most of the distribution in the scatterplot accross the x axis is between 0.0 and 2.5 acres. Although there are outlier oddities. If I were to take out outliers with high sales price or high acres, our dataset would be more clear to read. When observing the outliers, there isn't a correlation between price and acres. The acres with the highest count aren't high in price and vice versa for price. This leads me to believe that other variables are impacting this data.

## #4 Logan Pappas

- Range of Bedrooms variable -
```{r , include=TRUE}
range(ames$Bedrooms, na.rm = TRUE)
```
- Box Plot of Sale price compared to Bedrooms
```{r , include=TRUE}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = factor(Bedrooms), y = log10(`Sale Price`))) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

## Explanation

There are a few extreme outliers that are homes selling for several million dollars. This made most homes appear compressed near zero on the y-axis. Becuase of this I applied a log10 next to sales price to reveal a more of what the data shows. Homes with more bedrooms generally sold for more, but there was more variation within each category. Some 5+ bedroom homes sold for less than typical 3 or 4 bedroom homes, showing that other factors other than bedroom could influence price.
