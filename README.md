Isabelâ€™s Work:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Acres, y = `Sale Price`)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 89 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

- Most of the distribution in the scatterplot accross the x axis is
  between 0.0 and 2.5 acres. Although there are outlier oddities. If I
  were to take out outliers with high sales price or high acres, our
  dataset would be more clear to read.
